    KCacheGrind is reporting:

      half the work in each project.

  \frametitle{Why KCacheGrind Lies}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
  \item gprof reports time spent in {\tt f()} and {\tt g()},\\
    and how many times {\tt f()} calls {\tt g()}.
  \item callgrind also reports \\
     time spent  in {\tt g()}
     when called from {\tt f()}, \\
     i.e. some calling-context information.\\[1em]
   \item callgrind does \emph{not} report time spent in {\tt g()} \\
     when
     called from {\tt f()} when called from {\tt h()}.\\[1em]
     We don't get the {\tt project1} to {\tt manager} to {\tt worker1} link.\\[1em]
     \item (We have Edges but need Edge-Pairs).
