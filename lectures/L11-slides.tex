  \Large
  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
     \structure{Dependencies} are the main
      limitation to parallelization.\\[1em]
     Example: computation must be evaulated as {\tt XY} and not {\tt YX}.\\[1em]

  \frametitle{Not synchronization}

  \Large
  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
      Assume (for now) no synchronization problems.\\[1em]
      Only trying to identify code that is safe to run in
      parallel.

\item Dependencies limit the amount of parallelization.

Can we execute these 2 lines in parallel?
\begin{lstlisting}
x = 42
x = x + 1  
\end{lstlisting}
\pause
\alert{No.}\\[1em]
\begin{itemize}
\item Assume x initially 1. What are possible outcomes?
\pause \newline \structure{~~~x = 43 or x = 42}\\[1em]

Next, we'll classify dependencies.

Can we execute these 2 lines in parallel? (initially x is 2)
\begin{lstlisting}
y = x + 1
z = x + 5
\end{lstlisting}
\pause
\structure{Yes.}\\[1em]
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables y and z are independent.
\item Variable x is only read.
\end{itemize}

RAR dependency allows parallelization.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Read After Write (RAW)}

What about these 2 lines? (again, initially x is 2):
\begin{lstlisting}
x = 37
z = x + 5
\end{lstlisting}
\pause
\alert{No, z = 42 or z = 7.}\\[1em]

RAW inhibits parallelization: can't change ordering.\\
Also known as a \structure{true dependency}.

What if we change the order now? (again, initially x is 2)
\begin{lstlisting}
z = x + 5
x = 37
\end{lstlisting}
\pause
\alert{No. Again, z = 42 or z = 7.}\\[1em]
\begin{itemize}
\item WAR is also known as a \structure{anti-dependency}.
\item But, we can modify this code to enable parallelization.

\frametitle{Removing Write After Read (WAR) Dependencies}
\begin{changemargin}{1.8cm}
Make a copy of the variable:
\begin{lstlisting}
x_copy = x
z = x_copy + 5
x = 37
\end{lstlisting}
\pause
\structure{We can now run the last 2 lines in parallel.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Induced a true dependency (RAW) between first 2 lines.
\item Isn't that bad?
\end{itemize}
\pause
Not always:
\begin{lstlisting}
z = very_long_function(x) + 5
x = very_long_calculation()
\end{lstlisting}
\end{changemargin}

Can we run these lines in parallel? (initially x is 2)
\begin{lstlisting}
z = x + 5
z = x + 40
\end{lstlisting}
\pause
\alert{Nope, z = 42 or z = 7}.\\[1em]
\begin{itemize}
\item WAW is also known as an \structure{output dependency}.
\item We can remove this dependency (like WAR):
