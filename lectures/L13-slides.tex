  \frametitle{Shortcomings of Speculative Execution}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
  Consider the following code:
  
  \begin{lstlisting}
void doWork(int x, int y) {
    int value = longCalculation(x, y);
    return secondLongCalculation(value);
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  Now we have a true dependency; can't use speculative~execution.\\[1em]

  But: if the value is predictable, we can execute
      {\tt secondLongCalculation} using the predicted value.\\[1em]

  This is \structure{value speculation}.
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Value Speculation Implementation}

% note: v1 is meant to be the result you get from longCalculation this time, while last_value is what you got last time. (The code doesn't show that). If you get the same result from longCalculation this time as you did last time, then secondLongCalculation is correct and you don't need to redo it.
  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
  This Pthread code does value speculation:
  
  \begin{lstlisting}
void doWork(int x, int y) {
    thread_t t1, t2;
    point p(x,y);
    int v1, v2, last_value;
    thread_create(&t1, NULL, &longCalculation, &p);
    thread_create(&t2, NULL, &secondLongCalculation,
                  &last_value);
    thread_join(t1, &v1);
    thread_join(t2, &v2);
    if (v1 == last_value) {
      return v2;
    } else {
      last_value = v1;
      return secondLongCalculation(v1);
    }
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  Note: this is like memoization (plus parallelization).

                    semithick,initial text=]

  \begin{itemize}
    \item B depends on A, C has no dependencies, and D depends on B and C.
    \item Can execute A-then-B in parallel with C.

  \frametitle{Data and Task Parallelism}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
     \structure{Data parallelism} is performing \emph{the same} operations on
      different input.\\

     {\bf Example:} doubling all elements of an array.\\[1em]

     \structure{Task parallelism} is performing \emph{different} operations
      on different input.

    {\bf Example:} playing a video file: one thread decompresses
      frames, another renders.

  \frametitle{Data Parallelism: Single Instruction, Multiple Data}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
    We'll discuss SIMD in more detail later. An overview:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item You can load a bunch of data and perform 
      arithmetic.
    \item Intructions process multiple data items simultaneously.
      (Exact number is hardware-dependent).
    \end{itemize}
    For x86-class CPUs, MMX and SSE extensions provide SIMD instructions.
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{SIMD Example}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
  Consider the following code:

  \begin{lstlisting}
void vadd(double * restrict a, double * restrict b, 
          int count) {
  for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
    a[i] += b[i];
}    
  \end{lstlisting}

    In this scenario, we have a regular operation over block data.\\[1em]

    We could use threads, but we'll use SIMD.

  \frametitle{SIMD Example---Assembly without SIMD}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
If we compile this without SIMD instructions on a 32-bit x86, (flags {\tt -m32 -march=i386 -S}) we might get this:

  \begin{lstlisting}
loop:
  fldl  (%edx)
  faddl (%ecx)
  fstpl (%edx)
  addl  8, %edx
  addl  8, %ecx
  addl  1, %esi
  cmp   %eax, %esi
  jle   loop
  \end{lstlisting}

   Just loads, adds, writes and increments.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \frametitle{SIMD Example---Assembly with SIMD}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
 Instead, compiling to SIMD instructions\\ ({\tt -m32 -mfpmath=sse -march=prescott}) gives:

  \begin{lstlisting}
loop:
  movupd (%edx),%xmm0
  movupd (%ecx),%xmm1
  addpd  %xmm1,%xmm0
  movpd  %xmm0,(%edx)
  addl   16,%edx
  addl   16,%ecx
  addl   2,%esi
  cmp    %eax,%esi
  jle    loop
  \end{lstlisting}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Now processing two elements at a time on the same core.
    \item Also, no need for stack-based x87 code.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Operations \emph{packed}: operate on multiple data elements 
      at~the~same~time.
    \vfill
    \item On modern 64-bit CPUs, SSE has 16 128-bit registers.
    \vfill
    \item Very good if your data can be \emph{vectorized} and performs math.
    \vfill
    \item Usual application: image/video processing.
    \vfill
    \item We'll see more SIMD as we get into GPU programming: GPUs excel
       at these types of applications.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pattern 1: Multiple Independent Tasks}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
    Only useful to maximize system utilization.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Run multiple tasks on the same system \\ ~~~(e.g. database and web server).\\[1em]
     If one is memory-bound and the other is I/O-bound, for example, you'll
      get maximum utilization out of your resources.\\[1em]
     {\bf Example:} cloud computing, each task is independent and can
      tasks can spread themselves over different nodes.\\[1em]
    \item Performance can increase linearly with the number of threads.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pattern 2: Multiple Loosely-Coupled Tasks}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
    Tasks aren't quite independent, so there needs to be some inter-task
      communication (but not much).
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Communication might be from the tasks to a controller or status
      monitor.
  \end{itemize}

    Refactoring an application can help with latency. \\
For instance: split off
      the CPU-intensive computations into a separate thread---your application may
      respond more quickly.\\[1em]
     {\bf Example:} A program (1) receives/forwards packets and (2) logs them. You
      can split these two tasks into two threads, so you can still
      receive/forward while waiting for disk. This will increase the
      \structure{throughput} of the system.
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pattern 3: Multiple Copies of the Same Task}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
    Variant of multiple independent tasks: run multiple copies of the same task (probably on different data).

  \begin{itemize}
    \item No communcation between different copies.
  \end{itemize}

  Again, performance should increase linearly with number of tasks.\\[1em]

  {\bf Example:} In a rendering application, each thread can be
      responsible for a frame (gain \structure{throughput}; same
      \structure{latency}).

  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pattern 4: Single Task, Multiple Threads}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
  Classic vision of ``parallelization''.\\[1em]

  {\bf Example:} Distribute array processing over multiple 
      threads---each thread computes results for a subset of the array.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Can decrease \structure{latency} (and increase
      \structure{throughput}), as we saw with \structure{Amdahl's Law}.
    \item Communication can be a problem, if the data is not nicely partitioned.
    \item Most common implementation is just creating threads and joining them,
      combining all results at the join.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pattern 5: Pipeline of Tasks}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
    Seen briefly in computer architecture.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use multiple stages; each thread handles a stage.\\[1em]
     {\bf Example:} a program that handles network packets: (1) accepts
      packets, (2) processes them, and (3) re-transmits them. Could set up the threads such that each packet goes through the threads.
    \vfill
    \item Improves \structure{throughput}; may increase \structure{latency} as
      there's communication between threads.
    \vfill
    \item In the best case, you'll have a linear speedup.\\[1em]

     Rare, since the runtime of the stages will vary, and the slow
      one will be the bottleneck (but you could have 2 instances of the
      slow stage).
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pattern 6: Client-Server}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
    To execute a large computation, the server supplies work to many
      clients---as many as request it.\\[1em]

    Client computes results and returns them to the server.\\[1em]
   {\bf Examples:} botnets, {\tt SETI@Home}, GUI application (backend
      acts as the server).\\[1em]
   Server can arbitrate access to shared resources (such as network
      access) by storing the requests and sending them out.\\[1em]

   \begin{itemize}
    \item Parallelism is somewhere between single task, multiple threads and
      multiple loosely-coupled tasks  
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pattern 7: Producer-Consumer}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
    Variant on the pipeline and client-server models.\\
    Producer generates work, and consumer performs work.\\[1em]
    {\bf Example:} producer which generates rendered frames;
      consumer which orders these frames and writes them to disk.\\[1em]
    Any number of producers and consumers.\\[1em]

    \begin{itemize}
    \item This approach can improve \structure{throughput} and also reduces
      design complexity
    \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Combining Strategies}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
    Most problems don't fit into one category, so it's often best to combine
      strategies.\\[1em]

    For instance, you might often start with a pipeline, and then use
      multiple threads in a particular pipeline stage to handle one piece of
      data.\\[1em]
    Tip: estimate to see what divisions of strategies would work best
      (might have to do more iterations of Amdahl's law depending on the amount
      of strategies you can use).
