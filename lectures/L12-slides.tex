  We'll use speculation at a coarser-grained level:
      speculatively parallelize source code.\\[1em]

      Two ways: \structure{speculative execution} and
      \structure{value speculation}.

\section{Speculation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Speculative Execution: Example}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
Consider the following code:
  
  \begin{lstlisting}
void doWork(int x, int y) {
    int value = longCalculation(x, y);
    if (value > threshold) {
      return value + secondLongCalculation(x, y);
    }
    else {
      return value;
    }
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  Will we need to run {\tt secondLongCalculation}?
  \vfill  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<2> OK, so: could we execute {\tt longCalculation} and {\tt secondLongCalculation}
      in parallel if we didn't have the conditional?
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Speculative Execution: Assume No Conditional}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
  Yes, we could parallelize them. Consider this code:
    
    \begin{lstlisting}
  void doWork(int x, int y) {
    thread_t t1, t2;
    point p(x,y);
    int v1, v2;
    thread_create(&t1, NULL, &longCalculation, &p);
    thread_create(&t2, NULL, &secondLongCalculation, &p);
    thread_join(t1, &v1);
    thread_join(t2, &v2);
    if (v1 > threshold) {
      return v1 + v2;
    } else {
      return v1;
    }
  }
    \end{lstlisting}

  We do both the calculations in parallel and return the same result as before.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item What are we assuming about {\tt longCalculation} and
{\tt secondLongCalculation}?
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Estimating Impact of Speculative Execution}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
  $T_1$: time to run {\tt longCalculatuion}.

  $T_2$: time to run {\tt secondLongCalculation}.

  $p$: probability that {\tt secondLongCalculation} executes.\\[1em]

  In the normal case we have:
    \[T_{\mbox{\scriptsize normal}} = T_1 + pT_2.\]

  $S$: synchronization overhead.\\
  Our speculative code takes:
    \[ T_{\mbox{\scriptsize speculative}} = \mbox{max}(T_1, T_2) + S.\]

    \structure{Exercise.} When is speculative code faster? Slower? \\ How could you improve it?
