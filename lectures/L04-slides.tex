    Cannot improve performance if shared resources are the bottleneck.

    Issue instructions for each thread per cycle.

    To the OS, it looks a lot like SMP, but gives only up to 30\% performance improvement.

    In SMP, all CPUs have uniform (the same) access time for resources.

    For NUMA, CPUs can access different resources faster (resources: not just
          memory).
    \vfill
    Schedule tasks on CPUs which access resources faster.
    \vfill
    Since memory is commonly the bottleneck, each CPU has its own memory
          bank.

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
    Each task (process/thread) can be associated with a set of processors.
    \vfill
    Useful to take advantage of existing caches (either from the last time
          the task ran or task uses the same data).
    \vfill
    Hyper-Threading is an example of complete affinity for both threads on
          the same core.
    \vfill
    Often better to use a different processor if current set busy.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Background}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
  Recall the difference between \structure{processes} and 
          \structure{threads}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Threads are basically light-weight processes which piggy-back on
          processes' address space.
  \end{itemize} ~\\
  Traditionally (pre-Linux 2.6) you had to use {\tt fork}~(for~processes) and {\tt clone} (for threads).
  \end{changemargin}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{History}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
    {\tt clone} is not POSIX compliant.
    ~\\
    Developers mostly used {\tt fork} in the past, which creates a new process.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Drawbacks?
        \item Benefits?
      \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Benefit: {\tt fork} is Safer and More Secure Than Threads}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Each process has its own virtual address space:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Memory pages are not copied, they are copy-on-write---
        \item Therefore, uses less memory than you would expect.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Buffer overruns or other security holes do not expose other~processes.
    \item If a process crashes, the others can continue.
  \end{enumerate}~\\[1em]
  {\bf Example:} In the Chrome browser, each tab is a separate process.
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Drawback of Processes: Threads are Easier and Faster}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Interprocess communication (IPC) is more complicated and slower than interthread
          communication.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Need to use operating system utilities (pipes, semaphores, shared
              memory, etc) instead of thread library (or just memory reads and writes).
      \end{itemize}
    \item Processes have much higher startup, shutdown and synchronization cost.
    \item And, \structure{Pthreads}/\structure{C++11 threads} fix issues\\ with {\tt clone} and provide a
          uniform interface for most systems {\bf (Assignment 1)}.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Appropriate Time to Use Processes}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  If your application is like this:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mostly independent tasks, with little or no communication.
    \item Task startup and shutdown costs are negligible compared to overall runtime.
    \item Want to be safer against bugs and security holes.
  \end{itemize}
  Then processes are the way to go. \\[1em]

  For performance reasons, along with ease and consistency, we'll use
  \structure{Pthreads}.

  \frametitle{Results: Threads Offer a Speedup of 6.5 over {\tt fork}}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  Here's a benchmark between {\tt fork} and Pthreads on a laptop, creating and
  destroying 50,000 threads:
  \vfill
  \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\scriptsize]
jon@riker examples master % time ./create_fork 
0.18s user 4.14s system 34% cpu 12.484 total
jon@riker examples master % time ./create_pthread 
0.73s user 1.29s system 107% cpu 1.887 total
  \end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
  Clearly Pthreads incur much lower overhead than {\tt fork}.
