  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}

  So far, we've seen how to make things fast on one computer:
\begin{itemize}
\item threads;
\item compiler optimizations;
\item GPUs.
\end{itemize}
  To get a lot of bandwidth, though, you need lots of computers, \\
   \qquad (if you're lucky and the problem allows!)\\[1em]

  Today: programming for performance \\ \qquad with multiple computers via MPI.

  \frametitle{Key Idea: Explicit Communication}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
  Mostly we've seen shared-memory systems;\\
  \qquad complication: must manage contention.\\[1em]

  Recently, GPU programming: explicitly copy data.\\[1em]

  Message-passing: yet another paradigm.

  \frametitle{What is MPI?}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}

  {\bf Message Passing Interface:}

  A language-independent communation protocol\\ for parallel computers.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use it to run the same code on a number of \structure{nodes}\\ \qquad (different hardware
      threads; or servers in a cluster).
    \item Provides explicit message passing between nodes.
    \item Is the dominant model for high performance computing\\ \qquad (de-facto~standard).

  \frametitle{High Level View of MPI}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}

    MPI is a type of SPMD (single process, multiple data).\\[2em]

    Idea: have multiple instances of the same program, \\ all working on
      different data.\\[0.5em]

    The program could be running on the same machine, \\ or a cluster of machines.\\[0.5em]

    MPI facilitates communication of data between processes.

  \begin{itemize}

      \qquad often {\tt MPI\_COMM\_WORLD} for global channel.
    \item {\tt MPI\_Datatype}: just an enum, e.g. {\tt MPI\_FLOAT\_INT}, etc.\\[1em]


    \item {\tt dest}/{\tt source}: ``rank'' of the process (in a communicator) \\
      to send a
      message to/receive a message from;\\
        \qquad you may use {\tt MPI\_ANY\_SOURCE} in {\tt MPI\_Recv}.\\[1em]

    \item Both {\tt MPI\_Send} and {\tt MPI\_Recv} are blocking calls---\\
      \qquad see {\tt man MPI\_Send} or {\tt man MPI\_Recv} for more details.

    \item The {\tt tag} allows you to organize your messages, \\ \qquad so you can
      filter all but a specific tag.

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}

  To compute the matrix product $AB$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize MPI.
\item If the current process is the master task (task id 0):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize matrices.
\item Send work to each worker task: \\
row number (offset); number of rows;
row contents from $A$; complete contents of matrix $B$.

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Send(&a[offset][0], rows*NCA, MPI_DOUBLE, dest, 
         mtype, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
\end{verbatim}
}

\item Wait for results from all worker tasks (\verb+MPI_Recv+).
\item Print results.
\end{enumerate}
\item For all other tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Receive offset, number of rows, partial matrix $A$, and complete matrix $B$, using {\tt MPI\_Recv}:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Recv(&offset, 1, MPI_INT, MASTER, 
         mtype, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &status);
\end{verbatim}

  \frametitle{Other Things MPI Can Do}
  
  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}

    We can use nodes on a network (by using a {\tt hostfile}).\\[1em]
    We can even use MPMD:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\it multiple processes, multiple data}
      \end{itemize}~\\

  \begin{lstlisting}
% mpirun -np 2 a.out : -np 2 b.out
  \end{lstlisting}

  This launches a single parallel application.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item All in the same {\tt MPI\_COMM\_WORLD}; but
    \item Ranks 0 and 1 are instances of {\tt a.out}, and
    \item Ranks 2 and 3 are instances of {\tt b.out}.
  \end{itemize}~\\

  You could also use the {\tt --app} flag with an appfile \\ instead of typing out
  everything.

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}

 Your bottleneck for performance here is message-passing.\\[1em]
 Keep the communication to a minimum!\\[1em]
 In general, the more machines/farther apart they are, the slower the communication.\\[1em]

Each step from multicore
machines to GPU programming to MPI triggers an
order-of-magnitude decrease in communication bandwidth and  similar
increase in latency.

You want a server on the Internet.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  Once upon a time: had to get a physical machine hosted (e.g. in a rack).\\
  Or, live with inferior shared hosting.\\[1em]
\item Virtualization: pay for part of a
  machine on that rack.  \\
  A win: you're usually not maxing out a computer, and you'd
  be perfectly happy to share it with others, as long as there are
  good security guarantees. All users can get root access.\\[1em]
\item Clouds enable you to add more machines on-demand. \\ Instead of
  having just one virtual server, spin up dozens (or
  thousands) of server images when you need more compute
  capacity. \\

  Servers typically share persistent storage, also in
  the cloud.

Relational Database Service); or,
