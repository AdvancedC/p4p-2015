  \frametitle{Race Conditions}

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A race occurs when you have two concurrent accesses to the
      same memory location, at least one of which is a {\bf write}.
  \end{itemize}~\\

   When there's a race, the final state may not be the same as
      running one access to completion and then the other.\\[1em]
   Race conditions arise between variables which
      are shared between threads.

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
    Dynamic and static tools can help find data races in your program.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt helgrind} is one such tool. It runs your program 
      and analyzes it (and causes a large slowdown).
  \end{itemize}
    Run with {\tt valgrind --tool=helgrind <prog>}.\\[1em]
    It will warn you of possible data races along with locations.\\[1em]
    For useful debugging information, compile with debugging information
      ({\tt -g} flag for {\tt gcc}).

  \frametitle{Mutual Exclusion}

\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
    Mutexes are the most basic type of synchronization.
    \vfill
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Only one thread can execute code protected by a mutex at a time.
    \vfill
    \item All other threads must wait until the mutex is free before they can
      execute protected code.
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item {\bf Prioceiling}: specifies the priority ceiling of a mutex
    \item {\bf Process-shared}: specifies the process sharing of a mutex
  \end{itemize}
  You can specify a mutex as {\it process shared} so that you can access it
  between processes. In that case, you need to use shared memory and {\tt mmap},
  which we won't get into.

  Recall that \structure{dataraces} occur when two concurrent actions access the same
  variable and at least one of them is a {\bf write}.


  \begin{lstlisting}
...
static int counter = 0;

void* run(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        ++counter;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Create 8 threads
    // Join 8 threads
    printf("counter = %i\n", counter);

Is there a datarace in this example? If so, how would we fix it?
