  Difference between reentrant and thread-safe functions:\\[1em]

  {\bf Reentrancy}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Has nothing to do with threads---assumes a {\bf single thread}.
    \item Reentrant means the execution can context switch at any point in
      in a function, call the {\bf same function}, and {\bf complete} before
      returning to the original function call.
    \item Function's result does not depend on where the context switch happens.
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  {\bf Thread-safety}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Result does not depend on any interleaving of threads from
      concurrency or parallelism.
    \item No unexpected results from multiple concurrent executions of the function.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Inlining}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}

  We have seen the notion of inlining:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Instructs the compiler to just insert the function code in-place,
      instead of calling the function.
    \item Hence, no function call overhead!
    \item Compilers can also do better---context-sensitive---operations they couldn't
      have done before.
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  No overhead\ldots~ sounds like better performance\ldots~ \\let's inline everything!
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Inlining in C++}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  Implicit inlining (defining a function inside a class definition):
  \begin{lstlisting}
class P {
public:
    int get_x() const { return x; }
...
private:
    int x;
};
  \end{lstlisting}
  \vfill
Explicit inlining:
  \begin{lstlisting}
inline max(const int& x, const int& y) {
    return x < y ? y : x;
}
  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Other Side of Inlining}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}

  One big downside:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Your program size is going to increase.
  \end{itemize}
   This is worse than you think:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Fewer cache hits.
        \item More trips to memory.
      \end{itemize}
   Some inlines can grow very rapidly (C++ extended constructors).\\[1em]
  Just from this your performance may go down easily.
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Compilers on Inlining}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}

  Inlining is merely a suggestion to compilers.\\
  They may ignore you.\\[1em]

  For example:
n  \begin{itemize}
    \item taking the address of an ``inline'' function and using it; or
    \item virtual functions (in C++),
  \end{itemize}
  will get you ignored quite fast.
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{From a Usability Point-of-View}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  Debugging is more difficult (e.g. you can't set a breakpoint in a function that
  doesn't actually exist).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Most compilers simply won't inline code with debugging symbols on.
    \item Some do, but typically it's more of a pain.
  \end{itemize}~\\[1em]

  Library design:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If you change any inline function in your library, any users
      of that library have to {\bf recompile} their program if the
      library updates. (non-binary-compatible change!)
  \end{itemize}
  Not a problem for non-inlined functions---programs execute the new function
      dynamically at runtime.

  \frametitle{Introduction}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
    So far, we've only seen C---we haven't seen anything 
      complex.\\[1em]

    C is low level, which is good for learning what's
    really going on.\\[2em]

    Writing compact, readable code in C is hard. \\ Common C sights:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf \#define macros}
        \item {\bf void*}
      \end{itemize}
    C++11 has made major strides towards readability and efficiency
      (it provides light-weight abstractions).

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  Sort a bunch of integers.\\[1em]
  In {\bf C}, usually use qsort from {\tt stdlib.h}.

  \begin{lstlisting}
void qsort (void* base, size_t num, size_t size,
            int (*comparator) (const void*, const void*));
  \end{lstlisting}

  \begin{itemize}

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int array[] = {4, 3, 5, 2, 1};
    qsort(array, 5, sizeof(int), compare);
}

    \item Memory access is slow, and results arrive in blocks:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Lists' elements are all over memory, hence many
          cache misses.
        \item A cache miss for a vector will bring a lot more usable data.
      \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Don't store unnecessary data in your program.
    \vfill
    \item Keep your data as compact as possible.
    \vfill
    \item Access memory in a predictable manner.
    \vfill
    \item Use vectors instead of lists by default.
    \vfill
    \item Programming abstractly can save a lot of time.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Reentrancy vs thread-safety.
    \item Inlining: limit your inlining to trivial functions:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item makes debugging easier and improves usability;
        \item won't slow down your program before you even start optimizing it.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Tell the compiler high-level information but think low-level.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Often, telling the compiler more gives you better code.
    \vfill
    \item Data structures can be critical, sometimes more than complexity.
    \vfill
    \item {\bf Low-level code != Efficient}.
    \vfill
    \item Think at a low level if you need to optimize anything.
    \vfill
    \item Readable code is good code---\\ different hardware needs different
      optimizations.
