  \frametitle{Warning About Using OpenMP Directives}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}

  Write your code so that simply eliding OpenMP directives gives a valid program.\\[1em]

  For instance, this is wrong:
  \begin{lstlisting}
if (a != 0)
    #pragma omp barrier // wrong!
if (a != 0)
    #pragma omp taskyield // wrong!
  \end{lstlisting}

  Use this instead:
  \begin{lstlisting}
if (a != 0) {
    #pragma omp barrier
}
if (a != 0) {
    #pragma omp taskyield
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  \frametitle{Memory Model}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}

  OpenMP uses a {\bf relaxed-consistency, shared-memory} model:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item All threads share a single store called
      \structure{memory}.\\ ~~(may not actually represent RAM)\\[1em]
    \item Each thread can have its own {\it temporary} view of memory.\\[1em]
    \item A thread's {\it temporary} view of memory is not required to be
      consistent with memory.
  \end{itemize}~\\

  We'll talk more about memory models later.

    Makes the thread's temporary view of memory consistent with main

    The variables in the list are called the {\it flush-set}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Explaining Flush}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
  Enforcing an order on the memory operations means:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item All read/write operations on the {\it flush-set} which happen
      before the {\bf flush} complete before the flush executes.
    \item All read/write operations on the {\it flush-set} which happen
      after the {\bf flush} complete after the flush executes.
    \item Flushes with overlapping {\it flush-sets} can not be reordered.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Flush Correctness}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
  To show a consistent value for a variable between two threads, 
  OpenMP must run statements in this order:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $t_1$ writes the value to $v$;
    \item $t_1$ flushes $v$; 
    \item $t_2$ flushes $v$ also;
    \item $t_2$ reads the consistent value from $v$.

\begin{center}
  {\bf mergeable}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item For an undeferred or included task,

would be better as:

  \begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel for
for (i = 0 ; i < N; ++i) { 
    #pragma omp flush(max)
    if (arr[i] > max) {
          #pragma omp critical
          {
                if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
          }
    }
}
  \end{lstlisting}
