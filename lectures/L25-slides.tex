  \frametitle{Introduction to Profiling}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
    So far we've been looking at small problems.\\[1em]
    Must {\bf profile} to see what takes time in a
      large program.\\[1em]
    Two main outputs:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item flat;
        \item call-graph.
      \end{itemize}
~\\[1em]
    \item Two main data gathering methods:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item statistical;
        \item instrumentation.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Profiler Outputs}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
  {\bf Flat Profiler:}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Only computes the average time in a particular function.
    \item Does not include other (useful) information, like callees.
  \end{itemize}

~\\[1em]

  {\bf Call-graph Profiler:}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Computes call times.
    \item Reports frequency of function calls.
    \item Gives a call graph: who called what function?
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Data Gathering Methods}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
  {\bf Statistical:}

  Mostly, take samples of the system state, that is:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item every 100ms, check the system state.
    \item will cause some slowdown, but not much.
  \end{itemize}
~\\[1em]

  {\bf Instrumentation:}\\
  Add additional instructions at specified program points:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item can do this at compile time or run time (expensive);
    \item can instrument either manually or automatically;
    \item like conditional breakpoints.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Guide to Profiling}

  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  When writing large software projects:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First, write clear and concise code. \\
      Don't do any premature optimizations---focus on correctness.
    \item Profile to get a baseline of your performance:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item allows you to easily track any performance changes;
        \item allows you to re-design your program before it's too late.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  Focus your optimization efforts on the code that matters.
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Things to Look For}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
    Good signs:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Time is spent in the right part of the system.
      \item Most time should not be spent handling errors; in
      non-critical code; or in exceptional cases.
      \item Time is not unnecessarily spent in the operating system.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{changemargin}

  \frametitle{{\tt gprof} introduction}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
    Statistical profiler, plus some instrumentation for calls.\\[1em]
    Runs completely in user-space.\\[1em]
    Only requires a compiler.
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{{\tt gprof} usage}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
    Use the {\tt -pg} flag with {\tt gcc} when compiling and linking.\\[1em]
    Run your program as you normally would.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Your program will now create a {\tt gmon.out} file.
      \end{itemize}
~\\
    \item Use gprof to interpret the results: {\tt gprof <executable>}.
  \end{changemargin}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{{\tt gprof} example}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
    A program with 100 million calls to two math functions.

  \begin{lstlisting}
int main() {
    int i,x1=10,y1=3,r1=0;
    float x2=10,y2=3,r2=0;

    for(i=0;i<100000000;i++) {
        r1 += int_math(x1,y1);
        r2 += float_math(y2,y2);
    }
}
  \end{lstlisting}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Looking at the code, we have no idea what takes longer.
    \item Probably would guess floating point math taking longer.
    \item (Overall, silly example.)
